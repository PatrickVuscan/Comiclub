## Highlevel Structure
Inside of `actions` you will find our functions which call our backend APIs, and return the retrieved data.
Inside of `components` you will find our React Components, Routes, and Pages - folders signify which area of the app the components relate to, if there are enough of them to signify a folder. Otherwise, they're in the root of `components`.
